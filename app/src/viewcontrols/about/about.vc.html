            <h3 id='h3-1'>The game within the game.</h3>
            <p id='p-1'>CoverSharks was founded by a group of
                college football fans who have been playing
                a fantasy sports game called “Pick Six” for
                over a decade. As an alum and avid fan of
                the Crimson Tide, Bill Wilder first created the
                original concept behind the game app in
                2006. The idea was simple… give friends and
                college football fans alike the opportunity to
                engage in their favorite sport using an
                innovative format of game play that engages
                them in a unique, “game within the game”
                competition and enhances the overall
                entertainment experience.
